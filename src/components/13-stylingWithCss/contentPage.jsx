		<p>In this paragraph, I will just be testing the use of un-ordered lists.
		To do that, I will just write a random list of friends;

				Sheila

					<li>Light Skinned</li>

		<p>Don't mind this line a lot. <br/> It is just to test the new line thing.</p>

		<div class="container">
			<div class="jumbotron">
				<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-film"></span>
			</div>
		</div>

		
		<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> I wrote this line just to test the use of <b>"Strong"</b>. And to mention that you should
		not change anything about this page. </p>
		
		<p><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-film"></span>This line is to test the use of <b>em</b> which actually stands for <em>emphasis</em>. </p>
		
		<blockquote>
			<p>I used this line to Test the use of <em><b>blockquote.</b></em> You will notice that this paragraph is actually indented. It doesn't start from 
			where all the other paragraphs and lines start from.</p>
		</blockquote>
		
		<p><q>Without wonder, how could life ever be wonderful ?</q> This particular line, is to test the use of quotation in the text. So, the
		words that appear in qoutes, is a line from a song by <b>Switchfoot </b><q>Begin Forever.</q> This is from their most recent album that i know, 
		<em><b>Where the Light shines through.</b></em></p>
		
		<p>So recently..... Actually Currently, We are working on an <b>Android</b> <abbr title = "Application"> app.</abbr>
		The name of this app is, <acronym title = "Touch A Heart">TAH</acronym>. <br/>
		Now, the purppose of this paragraph is to test the use of abbreviations and acronyms on a web-page.
		Try moving the cursor over the words <b>app</b> and <b>TAH</b> on the previous line.</p>
		
		<p><cite><q>Selling the News,</q></cite> is a song by the American band Switchfoot. 
		This song talks about how the media industry in the world has gone to the dogs. <br/>
		This paragraph was used to test the use of <b>"cite"</b> which actually stands for citation. 
		the text in italics are the ones within the cite tag.</p>
		
		<p><dfn><acronym title="Social Studies">SSt</acronym></dfn> Is the study of man and his surrounding.
		<br/>So this paragraph was written just to test the use of <b>dfn</b>, which actually means defination.
		Am actually supprised that Chrome put it in Italics. The term we're defining is Social Studies, which we have written as SSt.</p>
		
		<br/><br/><hr/><br/><br/>
		
		<p>Please don't mind the line separating this paragraph from the other.
		I just did that to make the work look a little more organised.</p>
		
		<p>I actually didn't <del>had</del> <ins>have</ins> what to write in this paragraph. But I just ant to demonstrate the use of <b>ins</b> and <b>del.</b>
		I also tested the <s>strike-through</s> in this paragraph.</p>
		
		
		
		<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lFF2bkiHNVQ" target="black">Watch Ken Block drive with Captain Slow in the car.</a></p>
		
		<p>Well, the above text is a link. When clicked, it will lead one to a youtube video of Ken Block hosted on a Top Gear Show by James May. 
		Not in studio, but at an air field doing what he does best.<br/>
		So, this paragraph is to test the use of links. linking this page to another sight.
		<br/>I have further modified it to open the link in a new tab.</p>
		
		<p>In this paragraph, I will link to another web page known as; <a href="Trial2.html">Test Page 2</a></p>
		
		<p>In this paragraph, I won't do something so new. 
		I will just link to another page which is a <a href="Child/Trial_Child1.html">child page</a> to the directory <q><b>
		My html Exercising site</b></q></p>
		
		<p>Here, I will take you back to the <a href="#top">top</a> of this page. 
		If you wish to know the schools I attended, you can click <a href="#schools">here.</a></p>
